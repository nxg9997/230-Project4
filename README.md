# 230-Project4
Project 4 for Web Design &amp; Implementation

Description:
For my project, I want to do a few different visualizations. For the first page, I want to
incorporate what I have been working on in other classes to create some interesting AI
behaviour. I am going to have a group of objects that flock together and follow the user’s mouse
position. The objects will also move to avoid the mouse if they get to close to it. For my second
page, I want to have a kind of game where the user “slings” shapes around on the screen, and
when shapes collide they might break apart, combine, change colors, etc. For my third page, I
want to have an audio-visualization where the user can click around on the screen to generate a
sound effect depending on where they click as well as generating an animation to show that
they clicked.

Needed Resources:
I will need to include libraries that can handle animations for each page, another library
that can handle SVG manipulation for page 2, since shapes will be moving around the screen
frequently, and also a library that can handle audio for page 3.
Possible Resources:
● jQuery (animation)
● Anime.js (animation)
● Velocity.js (animation)
● SVG.js (SVGs)
● Snap.svg (SVGs)
● Howler.js (audio)
● Victor.js (vector math)
